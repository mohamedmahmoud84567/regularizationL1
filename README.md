# regularizationL1
We'll get practice with implementing regularization in this exercise. In this assignment's datalasso.csv, you'll find data for a bunch of points including six predictor variables and one outcome variable. we use sklearn's Lasso class to fit a linear regression model to the data, while also using L1 regularization to control for model complexity.
